PowerPi
=======
<h2>PowerPi is a python3 interfacing bridge between modbus connections and a MQTT broker.</h2>

This project is based of the amazing work of [Charles Godwin](mailto:magnum@godwin.ca)'s [pymagnum software](https://github.com/CharlesGodwin/pymagnum) and [Graham22](https://github.com/graham22)'s work [communicating with Midnite's classic MPPT charge controller](https://github.com/graham22/ClassicMQTT).  

To fit my use case, I needed a single project to talk to Magnum Energy's device's via Modbus (RS485) connection as well as to Midnite Solar's Classic 150 charge controller that could combine the data and transmit a universal payload back to my Home Automation System.

This allows remote monitoring and control of my off grid home remotely.
